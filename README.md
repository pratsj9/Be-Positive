# Be Positive
With the entire nation driving itself towards a digital core it is essential that medical assistance doesnâ€™t lag behind. In cases of emergency people often require a certain degree of health assistance (blood to be precise) and they may or may not get that depending on the situation and their location.
What we can achieve is a small but certain contribution to that field using this project.

From this project, our aim is to provide an application that will benefit patients in critical situations like requirement of a specific type of blood. This will reduce the overhead of finding a blood donor in a nearby location during emergency situations. Thus connecting blood donors and recipients is our prime focus.

> We built this app for final year engineering project and published paper on our research.
